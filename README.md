**3. Performance Metrics**
![Hr Performance Overview](Images/Performance.png)
- Performance by Tenure
  - Employees with 11–15 years of tenure have the highest performance levels (avg. 3.22), possibly due to peak career maturity or deep Institutional knowledge.
  - Newer employees (0–5 years) perform at a steady average of 3.15, reflecting a solid onboarding and early development structure.
  - A slight decline in performance is observed among employees with over 20 years of tenure (avg. 3.12), which may indicate a need for renewed engagement or development initiatives in this group.
- Departmental Performance
   - The sales Department performs slightly better than other departments (avg. 3.16)
   - The narrow performance rating range across departments reflects consistent managerial evaluation. While this consistency is positive, it may also suggest limited differentiation between high and average performers, potentially masking excellence or underperformance.
- Top Performers
  - Employee no 653, a sales executive, scored 100 points.
- Correlation between Performance and Training
  - Employees who underwent 2–4 training sessions performed consistently well (70–80 range).
  - Those with no or minimal training underperformed, highlighting the developmental value of structured learning.
- Correlation between Departmental Performance and monthly income
  - There’s a clear positive relationship between performance metrics and average monthly income. However, the pattern is non-linear, with income spikes at certain performance thresholds and plateaus at the top end.
  -  Sales showed wide income variation at similar performance levels—potentially reflecting commission structures or role-based incentives.
  -  HR and R&D displayed tighter clusters, where compensation followed a more consistent trajectory with performance.
  -  These gaps signal possible inequities in compensation strategy and opportunities to rebalance incentives.
-  Attrition
  - 31 top performers have left the organization, indicating potential risks in retaining high-value talent.
  - Employees who left with high performance scores may reflect underlying issues such as unmet career growth expectations, compensation misalignment or lack of recognition.
